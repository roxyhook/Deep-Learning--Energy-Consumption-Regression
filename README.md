The aim of this project is to build and evaluate Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to predict office building energy consumption. Through exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, baseline modeling, model modifications, and performance evaluation, the project demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be applied to improve prediction accuracy and provide insights for efficient energy management and sustainability.
